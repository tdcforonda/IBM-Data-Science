# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
This repository serves as a portfolio of data science projects that I used to complete the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate offered by Coursera.
## Courses üìî
The program consists of 9 online courses and 1 capstone project that will provide you with the **latest job-ready tools and skills**, including open source tools and libraries, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning algorithms. You‚Äôll learn data science through hands-on practice in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and real-world data sets.
