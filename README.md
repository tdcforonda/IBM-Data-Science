# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
This repository serves as a portfolio of data science projects that I used to complete the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate offered by Coursera.
## Courses üìî
The program consists of 9 online courses and 1 capstone project that will provide you with the **latest job-ready tools and skills**, including open source tools and libraries, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning algorithms. You‚Äôll learn data science through hands-on practice in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and real-world data sets.
###  ‚úÖ Course 1: What is Data Science?

This course served as a brief introduction of the tools, history, and careers in data science. The lectures provided advise on how to move forward in a data-driven world, as well as the next steps for data scientists as we progress further not just in technology but also society as a whole.

### ‚úÖ Course 2: Tools for Data Science

In this course, I learned about both commercial and open-source tools for data science that are available for each stage of development such as Data Management, Data Integration and Transformation, Data Visualization, Model Building, Model Deployment, Model Assessment, and many more. I utilized IBM's Watson Studio, Jupyter Notebooks, and RStudio to complete this part of the program.

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Course 3: Data Science Methodology
### ‚úÖ  Course 4: Python for Data Science, AI, and Development

I already had prior experience in Python before I took this course, so I treated it more as a review. In this course, the curriculum includes Python fundamentals, data science libraries, and an introduction to APIs.
